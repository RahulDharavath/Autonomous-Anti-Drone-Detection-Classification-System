# **Over View:**

* Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are increasingly used across multiple sectors, including border surveillance, security monitoring, and airspace safety.  
However, the growing presence of drones also introduces serious security risks, such as unauthorized intrusions and false threat alerts caused by birds or other aerial objects.

* This project presents a robust, real-time anti-drone detection and classification system built using YOLOv11m (20.03M parameters).  
The system detects and classifies aerial objects and triggers an alert only when a drone is detected with a confidence score greater than 70%, helping reduce false positives and improve operational reliability.

# 1. **PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
* The increasing use of drones has created serious security concerns across sensitive areas such as **international borders, restricted military zones, airports, critical infrastructure, tourist locations, and modern warfare environments**.

* Unauthorized drones pose a significant threat in restricted airspace, particularly around borders and airports.  
Manual monitoring systems are ineffective due to the **small size of drones** and their **visual similarity to birds**, which often results in **false alarms or missed detections**.

# **2. OBJECTIVE:**
* This project addresses these challenges by developing an **automated, AI-based anti-drone detection system** that generates alerts **only when the detection confidence crosses a safe threshold**, thereby reducing false alarms and improving detection reliability.
